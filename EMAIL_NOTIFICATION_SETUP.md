# Email Notification & UI Improvements

## ✅ FIXED: Works Without Email Configuration

The application now works perfectly **without** requiring email configuration. Email sending is completely optional!

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Close Button (X) in Shareable Link Modal
**File:** `src/app/fillnda/page.tsx`

The X button is now much more visible with:
- **Absolute positioning** at top-right corner (top-3, right-3)
- **White background** with shadow for contrast
- **Larger size** (w-7 h-7) with thicker stroke (strokeWidth={3})
- **Red hover effect** (hover:bg-red-50, hover:border-red-400)
- **Higher z-index** (z-50) to appear above all content
- **Border and shadow** for better visibility

### 2. Email Validation
**Files:** 
- `src/app/fillnda/page.tsx` (frontend validation)
- `src/app/api/ndas/send/route.ts` (backend validation)

Added email validation using regex: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
- Frontend validates before sending request
- Backend validates and returns 400 error if invalid
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. Optional Automatic Email Sending ⭐ NEW
**File:** `src/lib/email.ts`

- Made Resend initialization conditional (only if API key is set)
- Shows warning in console if email not configured
- Gracefully skips email sending without errors
- Application works perfectly without email configuration

### 4. Success Confirmation
**File:** `src/app/fillnda/page.tsx`

Added success banner in shareable link modal showing:
- ✅ Green success badge
- Clear message to share link with recipient
- Recipient email address displayed
- Works whether email is configured or not

## How It Works Now

### Without Email Configuration (Default):
- ✅ Everything works normally
- ✅ Shareable links are generated
- ✅ Modal shows success message
- ⚠️  Console shows: "Email not sent: RESEND_API_KEY not configured"
- ✅ You can still share via WhatsApp, Telegram, Copy, etc.

### With Email Configuration (Optional):
- ✅ Everything above, PLUS:
- ✅ Automatic email sent to recipient
- ✅ Professional HTML email with branded template
- ✅ Console shows: "Email sent successfully to: [email]"

## Setup Instructions

### To Enable Email Notifications:

1. **Sign up for Resend** (free tier available)
   - Go to https://resend.com
   - Create an account

2. **Get your API Key**
   - Dashboard → API Keys → Create API Key
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

3. **Configure Domain** (for production)
   - Add and verify your domain in Resend dashboard
   - Or use their test domain for development

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   Create `.env` file (or add to existing):
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
   MAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
   APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Restart Development Server**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

## Email Template Features

The recipient receives an HTML email with:
- Professional agreedo branding
- Clear call-to-action button
- Link that expires in 30 days
- Instructions on what they can do:
  - Review all NDA terms
  - Fill in their party information
  - Make changes or suggestions
  - Sign electronically when ready

## Testing

### Test Email Validation:
1. Try invalid emails: "test", "test@", "@test.com"
2. Should show error: "Please enter a valid email address."

### Test Email Sending (with RESEND_API_KEY set):
1. Enter valid recipient email
2. Click "Send for Signature"
3. Should see success modal with:
   - Green "Email Sent Successfully!" banner
   - Recipient email displayed
   - Shareable link
   - Share options
4. Recipient should receive email immediately

### Test without Email Configuration:
- Email sending will fail silently
- Request will still succeed
- Error logged to console
- User still gets shareable link

## UI Improvements

### Close Button (X):
- Positioned at absolute top-right corner
- White background with shadow for visibility
- Red hover effect to indicate close action
- Larger icon (7x7) with bold stroke
- Closes modal and redirects to "My Drafts"

### Success Banner:
- Green background (green-50)
- Email icon
- Bold confirmation text
- Shows recipient email address
- Positioned above shareable link section

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Email**: Caught at frontend and backend, clear error message
- **Email Send Failure**: Logged but doesn't fail the request
- **Missing RESEND_API_KEY**: Email sending skipped, request succeeds
- **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation, shareable link still works

## Next Steps

1. Set up Resend account and add API key to `.env`
2. Test email sending in development
3. Verify domain for production use
4. Consider adding email templates for:
   - NDA signed confirmation
   - Reminder emails
   - Status updates
