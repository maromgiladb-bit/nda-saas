# Email Not Sending - FIXED! ‚úÖ

## Problem Identified

The email wasn't sending because of the `MAIL_FROM` address configuration.

### Root Cause
**Issue**: `MAIL_FROM=maromgiladb@gmail.com`
- Resend requires you to either:
  1. Use their test domain: `onboarding@resend.dev` (works immediately)
  2. Verify your own domain in Resend dashboard
  3. Verify individual email addresses

Gmail addresses won't work unless verified in Resend!

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### Changed `.env.local`:
```bash
# OLD (didn't work):
MAIL_FROM=maromgiladb@gmail.com

# NEW (works immediately):
MAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
```

### Test Confirmed Working ‚úÖ
Ran test script and successfully sent email:
```
‚úÖ Success! Email sent: { id: '0379368b-2173-483b-84eb-2d096249747d' }
```

## Current Configuration

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_Vgq4Ps9J_LbRxanCqf9MkmvaiFeByLtvD
MAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev  # ‚Üê This is Resend's test domain
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Enhanced Logging Added

Added detailed console logs to help debug:
- `üìß` Email function calls
- `‚úÖ` Successful operations
- `‚ùå` Errors with details
- Environment variable checks

## Try It Now!

1. **Server is running**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Fill out an NDA form**
3. **Send for signature**
4. **Check your email!** (should arrive within seconds)

### Look for these console logs:
```
üìß Preparing to send email to: [email]
üìß sendEmail called with: [details]
üìß Attempting to send email via Resend...
‚úÖ Email sent successfully!
```

## For Production Use

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain (Recommended)
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `agreedo.app`)
3. Add DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for verification
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   MAIL_FROM=noreply@agreedo.app
   ```

### Option 2: Verify Individual Email
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Verify Email Address"
3. Enter `maromgiladb@gmail.com`
4. Check your inbox for verification email
5. Click verify link
6. Update `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   MAIL_FROM=maromgiladb@gmail.com
   ```

### Option 3: Keep Test Domain (Development Only)
- Current setup works fine for development
- Emails will show "from: onboarding@resend.dev"
- Not recommended for production
