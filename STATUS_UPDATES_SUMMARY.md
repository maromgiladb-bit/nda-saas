# Status Tracking Updates - Quick Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
NDA statuses weren't properly updating in the dashboard after actions like:
- Party B suggesting changes
- Party A reviewing suggestions  
- Documents being signed

### Solution
Comprehensive status tracking system that ensures:
✅ Every action updates the database status
✅ Dashboard displays accurate real-time status
✅ User-friendly status labels
✅ Action buttons appear based on status
✅ Proper visual indicators (colors, icons, animations)

## Key Changes

### 1. Dashboard Enhancement
**Added**:
- New "Action Needed" filter card for `PENDING_OWNER_REVIEW`
- 6-column grid (was 5) to accommodate all status types
- "Review Suggestions" button with pulse animation
- Friendly status labels (e.g., "Waiting for Your Review")
- Extended color palette for all 8 status states

**Status Cards**:
1. Total NDAs (All)
2. Draft (Gray)
3. **Action Needed (Yellow)** - NEW!
4. Waiting Review (Purple)
5. Sent (Purple)
6. Signed (Green)

### 2. API Updates
**File**: `/api/ndas/drafts/route.ts`

Added `sign_requests` to query response:
- Fetches active (unconsumed) tokens
- Enables "Review Suggestions" button to work
- Provides proper navigation to review pages

**What's Included**:
```typescript
sign_requests: {
  select: {
    token: true,
    scope: true,
    consumed_at: true
  },
  where: { consumed_at: null },
  orderBy: { created_at: 'desc' },
  take: 1
}
```

### 3. Status Flow (Complete)

```
CREATE → DRAFT
  ↓ Send
DRAFT → SENT
  ↓ Party B Suggests
SENT → PENDING_OWNER_REVIEW (⚠️ Action Needed)
  ↓ Party A Reviews
PENDING_OWNER_REVIEW → SENT (Back to Party B)
  ↓ Party B Signs
SENT → SIGNED (✓ Complete)
```
