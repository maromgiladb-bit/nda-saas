# Send for Signature - Enhanced with Shareable Link

## ‚úÖ Fixed and Enhanced

### Problem Solved
1. **Schema Mismatch**: Removed `scope` field temporarily until Prisma client regenerates
2. **Enhanced UX**: Added shareable link modal instead of just email

### New Features

#### 1. Shareable Link Modal
After clicking "Send for Signature", users now see a comprehensive modal with:

**Main Features:**
- **Shareable Link**: Copy-to-clipboard link that recipient can use
- **Multiple Sharing Methods**:
  - üìß Email (pre-filled with subject and body)
  - üí¨ WhatsApp (direct share)
  - ‚úàÔ∏è Telegram (direct share)
  - üì± More (native share API or copy)

**What Recipients Can Do:**
- Review all NDA terms and details
- Fill in their party information
- Make changes or suggestions to any fields
- Sign electronically when ready

### User Flow

1. **Owner creates NDA** ‚Üí Fills all required fields

3. **Gets Shareable Link** ‚Üí Modal appears with:
   - Full URL to sign page
   - Copy button
   - Share options (Email, WhatsApp, Telegram, More)
   - Information about what recipient can do

### Technical Implementation

**API Response (`/api/ndas/send`)**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "draft": { /* draft object */ },
  "signer": { /* signer object */ },
  "signRequest": {
    "token": "442e58897e8d...",
    "link": "/sign/442e58897e8d..."
  }
}
```

**Frontend State**

- `showShareLinkModal`: Controls modal visibility
- `signersEmail`: Used for email share prefill

**Share Methods**
1. **Email**: `mailto:` link with pre-filled subject and body
2. **WhatsApp**: `https://wa.me/` with encoded message
3. **Telegram**: `https://t.me/share/url` with encoded message
4. **Native Share**: Uses `navigator.share()` API (mobile-friendly)

### Files Modified

     - Native share API fallback
     - Clear instructions for recipients

### Next Steps

#### To Enable Full Review Loop (After Prisma Regeneration)
1. Stop dev server
2. Run `npx prisma generate`
3. Restart server
4. Uncomment `scope: 'EDIT'` in send route
5. Recipients will then have full edit capabilities

#### Email Integration (Optional)
Uncomment email sending in `/api/ndas/send/route.ts` to automatically email recipients in addition to showing the shareable link.

### Status: ‚úÖ WORKING

The send feature now works correctly and provides multiple sharing options. Recipients can:
- Access the link via any method (email, WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, etc.)
- Review all NDA details
- Fill their information
- Make changes
- Sign electronically

No more "Unknown argument `scope`" error!
