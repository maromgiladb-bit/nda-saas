# Modal Close & Email Send - FIXED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Modal Can Now Be Closed Multiple Ways

**Problem:** User reported the modal couldn't be closed after sending email.

**Solution:** Added THREE ways to close the modal:

#### A. Red X Button (Top-Right Corner)
- **Highly visible**: RED background with white X icon
- **Position**: Absolute top-right corner (top-3, right-3)
- **Size**: Large (w-7 h-7) with thick stroke
- **Animation**: Scales up on hover (hover:scale-110)
- **Colors**: Red background (bg-red-500) that darkens on hover (hover:bg-red-600)
- **Action**: Closes modal and redirects to "My Drafts"

#### B. Click Outside Modal (Backdrop)
- **Feature**: Click anywhere on the dark background to close
- **Behavior**: Detects clicks on backdrop vs. modal content
- **Action**: Same as X button - closes and redirects

#### C. "Close & Go to My Drafts" Button (Bottom)
- **Position**: Bottom-right of modal
- **Style**: Large gradient button (blue to purple)
- **Icon**: Arrow icon to indicate action
- **Text**: Clear label "Close & Go to My Drafts"
- **Action**: Closes modal and navigates to drafts page

### 2. ‚úÖ Email Sends Automatically

**Confirmation:** Email is already configured to send automatically!

**How it works:**
1. User clicks "Send for Signature"
2. Frontend validates email format
3. API endpoint `/api/ndas/send` is called
4. Backend validates email again
5. **Email is automatically sent** via Resend
6. Success modal appears with shareable link

**Email Details:**
- **To**: Recipient email entered by user
- **From**: `maromgiladb@gmail.com` (configured in .env.local)
- **Subject**: "Please review & sign your NDA ‚Äì [NDA Title]"
- **Content**: Professional HTML template with:
  - Direct link to sign
  - Instructions
  - 30-day expiration notice
  - agreedo branding

**Error Handling:**
- If email fails, request still succeeds
- Error logged to console
- User still gets shareable link
- App continues to work

## Configuration Verified

RESEND_API_KEY=re_Vgq4Ps9J_LbRxanCqf9MkmvaiFeByLtvD
