# Two-Party Review Loop Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Comprehensive implementation of a review loop system for your NDA SaaS "agreedo" that enables iterative collaboration between document owner and recipient with tracked changes, per-field comments, and provisional signing.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components

#### 1. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **New Enums:**
  - `ActorRole`: OWNER, RECIPIENT
  - `TokenScope`: VIEW, EDIT, SIGN, REVIEW
  - Updated `draft_status`: Added PENDING_OWNER_REVIEW, NEEDS_RECIPIENT_CHANGES, READY_TO_SIGN, WAITING_REVIEW

- **New Model: `nda_revisions`**
  - Stores full revision history with diffs
  - Per-field comments stored as JSON
  - Tracks actor (owner/recipient), revision number
  - Includes base_form, new_form, and computed diff

- **Updated Models:**
  - `nda_drafts`: Added `last_actor`, `provisional_recipient_signed_at`, `revisions` relation
  - `sign_requests`: Added `scope`, `editable_fields`, `payload` for flexible token management

#### 2. Core Utilities

**`src/lib/diff.ts`** - JSON Diff Engine
- Uses `jsondiffpatch` library
- Functions:
  - `diffForms()`: Compute diff between two form states
  - `listChanges()`: Convert diff to flat array with JSON pointers
  - `formatFieldPath()`: Human-readable field names
  - `applyDiff()`: Apply diff for reconstruction

**`src/lib/email.ts`** - Email System
- Integrated with Resend API
- Email templates:
  - `recipientEditEmailHtml()`: Edit invitation with optional owner message
  - `ownerReviewEmailHtml()`: Review request with change summary
  - `finalSignedEmailHtml()`: Fully signed notification
  - `recipientSignRequestEmailHtml()`: Sign request after approval
- All emails use "agreedo" branding

#### 3. API Endpoints

**`/api/ndas/recipient-update/[token]` (PATCH)**
- Validates EDIT or SIGN scope tokens
- Accepts form_data, message, submitAndSign flag, and comments
- Creates revision with diff computation
- Updates draft status to PENDING_OWNER_REVIEW
- Generates owner review token (TokenScope.REVIEW)
- Sends email with change summary to owner
- Supports provisional signing (submitAndSign=true)

**`/api/revisions/[revisionId]/comments` (POST, GET)**
- POST: Add comment to specific field path
  - Author can be OWNER or RECIPIENT
  - Appends to revision.comments JSON
  - Returns updated comment thread
- GET: Fetch comments for specific path or all comments
- Thread-safe comment storage

**`/api/review/approve/[token]` (POST)**
- Validates REVIEW scope token
- Two paths:
  1. **If recipient provisionally signed:**
     - Finalizes NDA (status = SIGNED)
     - Marks both signers as signed
     - Generates final PDF (placeholder)
     - Emails final document to all parties
  2. **If not signed yet:**
     - Sets status to READY_TO_SIGN
     - Creates recipient SIGN token
     - Sends sign request email
- Creates audit events

**`/api/review/request-more/[token]` (POST)**
- Validates REVIEW scope token
- Accepts owner message explaining required changes
- Sets status to NEEDS_RECIPIENT_CHANGES
- Clears provisional signature
- Creates new recipient EDIT token
- Sends email to recipient with owner's message
- Creates audit event

#### 4. Owner Review UI

**`/review/[token]/page.tsx`** (Server Component)
- Validates review token
- Loads draft + latest revision
- Computes formatted changes
- Handles expired/consumed tokens
- Passes data to client component

**`/review/[token]/ReviewPageClient.tsx`** (Client Component)
- **Header Section:**
  - Draft title and revision badge
  - Recipient message display
  - Provisional signing indicator
- **Tracked Changes Table:**
  - Field name with comment count badge
  - Before/After values with color coding (redâ†’green)
  - Inline comment threads per field
  - Add comment input with real-time updates
  - Shows author and timestamp for each comment
- **Review Actions:**
  - "Approve Changes" button
  - "Approve & Sign Now" (if provisionally signed)
  - "Request More Changes" with message textarea
  - Loading states and error handling

## Workflow Overview

### Initial Send (Existing Flow)
1. Owner creates draft and sends to recipient
2. System creates EDIT token for recipient
3. Recipient receives email with `/sign/[token]` link

### Review Loop Cycle

#### Recipient Submits Changes
1. Recipient edits fields in `/sign/[token]`
2. Adds per-field comments (optional)
3. Clicks "Submit Changes" or "Submit & Sign"
4. System creates Revision Rn with diff
5. Draft status â†’ PENDING_OWNER_REVIEW
6. Owner receives review link `/review/[token]`

#### Owner Reviews
1. Owner opens `/review/[token]`
2. Sees all changed fields in table
3. Can add comments to any field
4. Chooses action:

**Option A: Approve**
- If recipient signed â†’ NDA finalized (SIGNED)
- If not signed â†’ status READY_TO_SIGN, recipient gets SIGN token

**Option B: Request More Changes**
- Enters message explaining what's needed
- Status â†’ NEEDS_RECIPIENT_CHANGES
- Recipient gets new EDIT token
- Loop continues (next revision R{n+1})

### Finalization
- Both parties signed â†’ status = SIGNED
- Final PDF generated and emailed to all
- All tokens consumed
- Audit trail complete

## Security & Data Integrity

- **Token Validation:**
  - Scope checking (VIEW/EDIT/SIGN/REVIEW)
  - Expiration checking (30 days default)
  - Consumed check (prevents reuse)

- **State Machine:**
  - Status transitions enforced
  - last_actor tracking
  - Audit events for all actions

- **Comments:**
  - Immutable once added
  - Timestamped with ISO 8601
  - Author attribution (OWNER/RECIPIENT)

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "jsondiffpatch": "^0.6.0",
  "resend": "^4.0.0"
}
```

## Environment Variables Required

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
MAIL_FROM=noreply@agreedo.app
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Testing)
1. **Stop dev server** (if running)
2. Run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate client with new schema
3. Restart dev server with `npm run dev`

### Integration with Existing Sign Page
Update `/sign/[token]/page.tsx` to:
- Display per-field comment button (ðŸ’¬)
- Show existing comment threads
- Submit comments along with form_data
- Handle EDIT vs SIGN scope tokens

### PDF Generation
Implement final PDF generation in approve endpoint:
- Use existing Puppeteer/Handlebars setup
- Store in `final_key` field
- Generate download endpoint `/api/ndas/[id]/download`
