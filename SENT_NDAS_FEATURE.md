# Sent NDAs Dashboard Feature - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## What Was Added

### Database Changes
**No schema changes needed!** The existing structure already supports this:
- `nda_drafts.status` is updated to `SENT` when an NDA is sent
- `signers` table tracks recipient email, role, and status
- Relationship between drafts and signers already exists

### API Changes

#### Updated: `/api/ndas/drafts` (GET)
**File**: `src/app/api/ndas/drafts/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only fetched DRAFT status
const drafts = await prisma.nda_drafts.findMany({
  where: { created_by_id: dbUser.id, status: 'DRAFT' },
  orderBy: { updated_at: 'desc' }
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Fetches ALL statuses (DRAFT, SENT, SIGNED, etc.)
const drafts = await prisma.nda_drafts.findMany({
  where: { created_by_id: dbUser.id },
  orderBy: { updated_at: 'desc' },
  include: {
    signers: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        email: true,
        role: true,
        status: true,
        signed_at: true,
        created_at: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Returns drafts with ALL statuses
- ✅ Includes signer information (email, status, etc.)
- ✅ Better logging for debugging

### Dashboard Changes

#### Enhanced: NDA List Display
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Added for SENT NDAs:**
- 📧 **Recipient email display** - Shows who the NDA was sent to
- 📅 **Sent date** - Shows when it was sent
- 🎨 **Visual indicators** - Purple icon and color scheme for SENT status
- 📊 **Status filtering** - Click "Sent" card to filter only sent NDAs

**Before:**
```
[Icon] NDA Title
       Updated Oct 15, 2025
```

**After (for SENT NDAs):**
```
[Icon] NDA Title
       Updated Oct 15, 2025 • 📧 Sent to: recipient@email.com
```

## How It Works

### When User Sends an NDA:

1. **User fills out form** in `/fillnda`
2. **Clicks "Send for Signature"**
3. **Backend processes** (`/api/ndas/send`):
   - ✅ Updates draft status to `SENT`
   - ✅ Creates signer record with recipient email
   - ✅ Creates sign request with token
   - ✅ Sends email to recipient
   - ✅ Creates audit event
4. **Success modal shows** with shareable link
5. **Dashboard automatically updates** to show sent NDA

### Dashboard Display:

1. **Statistics Cards** show count of sent NDAs
2. **Click "Sent" card** to filter
3. **Each sent NDA shows:**
   - Title
   - Status badge (purple "SENT")
   - Updated date
   - Recipient email
   - Action buttons (View)

## Visual Features

### Status Color Coding:
- **DRAFT**: Gray
- **SENT**: Purple 💜
- **SIGNED**: Green
- **WAITING_REVIEW**: Yellow
- **VOID**: Red

### Icons:
- **DRAFT**: Pencil/Edit icon
- **SENT**: Paper plane/Send icon
- **SIGNED**: Checkmark icon

### Sent NDA Card Shows:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [📤] NDA Title                    [SENT] [View]  │
│      Updated Oct 15, 2025                        │
│      📧 Sent to: recipient@example.com           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
